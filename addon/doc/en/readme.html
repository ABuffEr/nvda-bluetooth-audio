<p>Bluetooth Audio is  an NVDA add-on that improves sound quality when working with bluetooth headphones or speakers.</p>
<p>Most bluetooth devices enter sleep mode after a few seconds of inactivity. That means that when NVDA starts speaking again, the first split second of sound will be lost. Bluetooth Audio add-on prevents bluetooth devices from entering sleep mode by constantly playing an ultra low pitch sound, that is inaudible to a human ear.</p>
<p>Warning: using Bluetooth Audio add-on will likely reduce battery life of your bluetooth device.</p>
